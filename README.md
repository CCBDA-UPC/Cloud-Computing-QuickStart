# Quick Start Knowledge Toolbox

These hands-on are a set of "simple Beginner's guide" that provides a fast-paced introduction to the basic technologies required for many of my courses at the *Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona*  (Barcelona School of Informatics, FIB), the teaching institution of the *Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC)* in charge of the university education in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, and related matters.

This set of Hands-on are intended for those students on my Masters' Courses who have no prior knowledge of these technology, to help them learn the required background knowledge necessary to follow the courses. Let me stress again the importance of hands-on practice while you are exploring new technical knowledges. My recommentation is that you should read any of these guides on a computer and try to follow along.
