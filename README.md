# Quick Start Knowledge Toolbox

These hands-on are a set of "simple Beginner's guides" that provide a fast-paced introduction to the basic technologies required for many of the courses that Jordi Torres teaches at the *Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona*  (Barcelona School of Informatics, FIB), the teaching institution of the *Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC)* in charge of university education in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, and related matters.

This set of Hands-on is intended for those students on Masters' Courses who have no prior knowledge of these technologies, to help them learn the required background knowledge, necessary to follow the courses. Let's bear in mind the importance of hands-on practice while you are exploring new technical knowledge. This material has been written for anyone to read it on a computer and try to follow all the proposed exercises.
