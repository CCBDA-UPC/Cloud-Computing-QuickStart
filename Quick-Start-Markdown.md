# Markdown syntax

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. It is very popular among computer science engineers because it is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, such as \# or \*. Github uses its own version of the Markdown syntax which provides an additional set of useful features. This is a subset of Github-flavored Markdown syntax that I'm using.


# Markdown code for "Headers"
We have 6 levels:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Alternatively, for Header 1 and Header 2, an underline-ish style:
```
Header 1
========

Header 2
--------
```

Header 1
========

Header 2
--------


# Markdown code for "Emphasis"
We have italics, bold, italic+bold and strikethrough:

```
Italics, use *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold, use **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Italic+Bold use **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough use two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```

Italics, use *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold, use **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Italic+Bold use **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough use two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~


Highlighting code inline isn't part of the Markdown spec, however Github supports it, using `backticks around` the specific code: 

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `backticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `backticks around` it.


# Markdown code for "Ordered Lists"
Actual numbers don't matter in an ordered list, it only matters that there's a number. Lists can be ordered or unordered. A text box can be aligned with the item above as shown in the example (use three spaces to indent):
```
1. List Item 1
1. List Item 2
   1. Ordered sub-list Item 1
   3. Ordered sub-list Item 2
5. List Item 3
   * Unordered sub-list item 1
   * Unordered sub-list item 2
  
    Some text that should be aligned with the above item.
   
    Another text that should be aligned with the above item.  
   
7. List Item 4

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.
   
   Another text that should be aligned with the above item.
```

1. List Item 1
1. List Item 2
   1. Ordered sub-list Item 1
   3. Ordered sub-list Item 2
5. List Item 3
   * Unordered sub-list item 1
   * Unordered sub-list item 2
   
     Some text that should be aligned with the item above .
   
     Another text that should be aligned with the item above.  
    
7. List Item 4
   
   Some text that should be aligned with the item above.
   
   Another text that should be aligned with the item above.
 
# Markdown code for "Unordered Lists"
Unordered list can use asterisks, or minuses, or pluses.

```
* List Item 1
* List Item 2
     1. Ordered sub-list Item 1
     3. Ordered sub-list Item 2
+ List Item 3
  * Unordered sub-list item 1
  * Unordered sub-list item 2
  
- List Item 4
   Some text that should be aligned with the item above.
   Another text that should be aligned with the item above.
```
* List Item 1
* List Item 2
   1. Ordered sub-list Item 1
   3. Ordered sub-list Item 2
+ List Item 3
   * Unordered sub-list item 1
   * Unordered sub-list item 2
- List Item 4
   Some text that should be aligned with the item above.
   Another text that should be aligned with the item above.

# Markdown code for "Links"
We have 3 ways to create links:
```
[This is an inline-style link to my web page](http://www.angeltoribio.com)

URLs will automatically get turned into links: http://www.angeltoribio.com

```

[This is an inline-style link to my web page](http://www.angeltoribio.com)

```
URLs will automatically become links: http://www.angeltoribio.com
```

URLs will automatically become links: http://www.angeltoribio.com

You can also use numbers or text for reference-style a link:
```
[This is a reference-style link to my web page][text_or_number]

[text_or_number]: http://www.angeltoribio.com
```
[This is a reference-style link to my web page][text_or_number]

[text_or_number]: http://www.angeltoribio.com

Finally, despite it isn't part of the Markdown spec, if you want to link to a specific position in the same page `.md` you can create a label as:

```
<a name="code"/>
```
above the text to want to have a link to and to create a link to that position use
```
[Code](#code)  
```
<a name="code"/>
[Code](#code)  

# Markdown code for "Images"
We can insert images by using either an inline-style or a reference-style:
```
![UPC Barcelona Tech](./img/UPClogo.png "UPC logo")

![UPC Barcelona Tech][UPC-logo]

[UPC-logo]: ./img/UPClogo.png "UPC logo"

```
![UPC Barcelona Tech](./img/UPClogo.png "UPC logo")


![UPC Barcelona Tech][UPC-logo]

[UPC-logo]: ./img/UPClogo.png  "UPC logo"




# Markdown code for "Bloc code"

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three backticks <code>```</code>, or are indented using four spaces. I only recommend using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier to spot and they support syntax highlighting.

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, therefore no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
```
</code></pre>



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, therefore no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

# Markdown code for "Tables"
You can add tables using colons to align column content: 

```no-highlight

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

```

| Tables        | Are           | Cool |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

```
Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Markdown code for "Blockquotes"


```no-highlight
> This is a quote.
> This line is part of the same quote.
```

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

```
> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.
```

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.

# Markdown code for "inline HTML"

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. 

```no-highlight
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>



# Markdown code for "Horizontal Rule"

# Youtube videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```no-highlight
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```


# Backslash escapes
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax. 
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

Character | Code | Description
--- | --- | ---
 **\\**   | `\\` | back slash
 **\`**   | ```\` ``` | backtick
 \*    | `\*` | asterisk
 **\_**   | `\_` | underscore
 **\{\}**  | `\{\}` | curly braces
 **\[\]**  | `\[\]` | square brackets
 **\(\)**  | `\(\)` | parentheses
 **\#**   | `\#` | hash mark
 **\+**   | `\+` | plus sign
 **\-**   | `\-` | minus sign (hyphen)
 **\.**   | `\.` | dot
 **\!**   | `\!` | exclamation mark
