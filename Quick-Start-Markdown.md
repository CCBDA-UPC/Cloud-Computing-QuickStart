# Markdown syntax

Markdown is a way to style text on the web very popular between computer science engineers. Monstly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thorwn in, like \# or \*. Github uses its own version of the Markdown syntax tjat provides an additional set of useful features. This is a subset of Github-flavored Markdown syntax that I'm using.

# Markdown codes for "Headers"
We have 6 levels:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Alternatively, for Header 1 and Header 2, an underline-ish style:
```
Header 1
========

Header 2
--------
```

Header 1
========

Header 2
--------


# Markdown codes for "Emphasis"
We have italics, bold, italic+bold and strikethrough:

```
Italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Italic+Bold with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough with two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```
