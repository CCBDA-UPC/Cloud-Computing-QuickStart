# Getting Started in the Cloud (with AWS)

## Create EC2 AWS instances
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the Amazon Web Service you can use to create and run virtual machines in the cloud (AWS call these virtual machines 'instances'). 
If you have not yet created an EC2 instance, you can follow this [step-by-step guide to launch a Linux virtual machine](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/) on Amazon EC2 within an [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

## Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH
After you launch your instance, in this [link](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) you could find more details about how to interact with your EC2 instance
