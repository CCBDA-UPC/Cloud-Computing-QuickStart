# Getting Started in the Cloud (with AWS)

## Create EC2 AWS instances
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the Amazon Web Service you can use to create and run virtual machines in the cloud (AWS call these virtual machines 'instances'). If you're not familiar with Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, don't worry, you can choose a 14.04 or 16.04 version, that are the most common at this moment. Amazon Linux is similar but a little bit different, but for our purposes works fine too.
If you have not yet created an EC2 instance, you can follow this [step-by-step guide to launch a Linux virtual machine](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/) on Amazon EC2 within an [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

## Connecting to your Linux Instance Using SSH
After you launch your instance, using this [link](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) you can find more details about how to interact with your EC2 instance 

## Alternative
If you prefer to use another Cloud provider instead AWS, please feel free to do so. However, you should indicate your decision to your teacher (by email is enough) before starting the assignments.
